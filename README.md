# Flow - Daily Task and Finance Manager

A simple, focused mobile application that combines task management and personal finance tracking in one streamlined interface. Built for users who want essential functionality without unnecessary complexity.

## About

Flow is my first mobile application, currently under App Store review. I created this app primarily for personal use because existing task and finance apps were bloated with features I didn't need. My goal was to design a simple, focused tool that helps track both daily tasks and purchases without the clutter.

## Features

- **Purchase Logging** - Record and categorize personal expenses
- **30-Day Activity History** - View comprehensive history of tasks and purchases
- **Real-time Sync** - Data syncs across devices instantly
- **Clean, Mobile-First UI** - Responsive design optimized for mobile use
- **User Authentication** - Secure account management

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React Native
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with real-time sync
- **Platform:** iOS (App Store submission in progress)
